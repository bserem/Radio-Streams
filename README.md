# Radio-Streams
A list of playlist files for nice radio stations around the world.

This list is just a compilation of playlist files, usualy available
online by the stations themselves.

If you have any good radio stations, especially with few or no advertisements
please let me know.

# Naming Convention
Filenames mention the location of the stream, not the style. Where available
information on the FM Band is used. Also, stations with no ads say so in the
end of the filename.
There is no style categorization, just experiment with all of them :)

# Other Stuff
I am not affiliated in any way with these stations.
